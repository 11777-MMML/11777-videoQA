<summary> <b>Abstract</b> </summary>

*What makes a video task uniquely suited for videos, beyond what can be understood from a single image?* Building on recent progress in self-supervised image-language models, we revisit this question in the context of video and language tasks. We propose the atemporal probe (ATP), a new model for video-language analysis which provides a stronger bound on the baseline accuracy of multimodal models constrained by image-level understanding. By applying this model to standard discriminative video and language tasks, such as video question answering and text-to-video retrieval, we characterize the limitations and potential of current video-language benchmarks. We find that understanding of event temporality is often not necessary to achieve strong or state-of-the-art performance, even compared with recent large-scale video-language models and in contexts intended to benchmark deeper video-level understanding. We also demonstrate how ATP can improve both video-language dataset and model design. We describe a technique for leveraging ATP to better disentangle dataset subsets with a higher concentration of temporally challenging data, improving benchmarking efficacy for causal and temporal understanding. Further, we show that effectively integrating ATP into full video-level temporal models can improve efficiency and state-of-the-art accuracy.

## Atemporal Probe (ATP): Code and Set-up

In this repo, we release the code for our **atemporal probe (ATP)** model for video-language analysis, designed to help identify cases of single frame or "atemporal" bias in discriminative video-language task settings. This code is tested with:

- Ubuntu 18.04
- PyTorch >= 1.8
- CUDA >= 10.1

```sh
# create your virtual environment
conda create --name atp python=3.7
conda activate atp

# dependencies
conda install pytorch==1.8.0 torchvision==0.9.0 cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch
conda install pandas

# optional (for feature extraction); see also data/DATA.md
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git
```

Please look at `src/` for more details on the provided code in this repo.

In our paper, ATP operates on top of (frozen) CLIP features for image and text encodings (ViT-B/32). For more info on dataset and feature processing please refer to `data/DATA.md`. The code in this repo is intended to be non-specific to any one encoder: feel free to try/modify for your own features and datasets!
